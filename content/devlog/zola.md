This site was built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), heavily inspired from [bevy-website](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy-website).
Zola is a static site generator (SSG), similar to Hugo, Pelican, and Jekyll, written in Rust on top of a template engine called Tera.

My previous website was built in Flutter when the framework had just released web support. Unfortuantely, Flutter matured into a mobile app focus framework and did not develop any of its web features, so I migrated to a framework more optim ized for static sites.
